title: 'This Is Big: Announcing the Agile BPA Awards'
---

I say this often, but if there is one industry that needs disrupting, it's the government. Our government as a whole is quite risk adverse and as a result, technology adoption moves at a glacial pace. However, it's for this very reason that the GSA's recent [Agile Delivery Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/28/announcing-the-agile-BPA-awards/) is significant: it's a fundamental change to the way the government acquires software.

### You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?

When I see a new product, I want to try it out (for free), compare it against their competitors, and decide whether it is the best product for me. In such a volatile environment, tech companies often talk about minimum viable product (MVP), A/B testing, and conversion rates to quickly obtain quantifiable metrics whether it's worth investing any time or money into a feature.

... but why don't we (the citizens) ask the government do this? Why don't they ask for demos and prototypes BEFORE they award the contract? After all, the money being spent is our tax money. As a tax payer, I don't want to hear about failed projects and sunken costs. I want my money to go toward projects that provide the largest amount of social good. To be perfectly honest, I'd also like to obtain the largest amount of social good for the least amount in taxes.

### This is where the GSA's Agile BPA changes everything

The bid process required using open source software in an open manner. Instead of submitting a large overwhelmingly boring document, potential bidders had to submit a working prototype via GitHub.  This means that any interested party, such as a tax-payer or civic hacker, can review the submissions and the work of each selected team.

This is one of the most transparent government procurements that I've ever seen and it's an indication that government leaders are truly starting to understand the benefits of agile software delivery by asking companies to **show** (rather than **tell**) them that they're capable of delivering.

In the future, I want to see government IT program managers evolve from being contract officers or management/oversight into product managers or product owners. If government agencies can truly adopt the open source mindset, it would be amazing to see government project managers become more like the core maintainers of open source software and allow volunteers to contribute to solving social problems.
