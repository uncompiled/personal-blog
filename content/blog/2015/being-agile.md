title: Thoughts on Being Agile
---

A few months ago, Jeff Sutherland published [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half-ebook/dp/B00JI54HCU/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=). As this book makes rounds through Managementland, I've been reflecting on what it really means to be agile. If you work in IT or software development, then you're probably familiar with terms like Agile, Lean, Kanban, or Scrum. These are [not new ideas](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game/ar/1), but I'm hearing a lot about implementing agile management in the enterprise and the problem that I see with the adoption of agile at the enterprise level is that **you're probably doing it wrong.**

There's a saying that some teams are "doing agile versus being agile".  In my experience as an IT consultant, it's also fairly common.  Many organizations attempt to incorporate agile practices without embracing the mindset of being [agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/). Large and mature organizations love process, but agile isn't about following a process. You can't simply implement a daily scrum, rebrand your requirements as user stories, and expect success. In fact, you shouldn't expect success at all. In the agile world, success is the result of creating highly effective teams that get things done.

### Thoughts on Management

Agile is a fundamental shift in the way that value is delivered and that requires active engagement from management.  Management can't simply tell the delivery teams to be agile and walk away; they need to be agile too. If management maintains a command-and-control mindset, agile adoption will fail. Scrum is not a process, it's a framework for building highly effective teams and when you have a highly effective team, the worst thing that you could do is tell them what to do.

Let's look at one example how management can sabotage agile teams. Some managers love project planning and reports, so here's a fun metric:

> (# of story points completed in sprint) / (# of story points committed to sprint)

What does this mean?  It's the deviation of the actual work performed from the work that was planned for the sprint. If you're doing this: **STOP**. As long as each sprint is planned to match the velocity of your team, this metric is pointless. Furthermore, if your team thinks that you value this metric, then they'll commit to doing less work so that your numbers look better. Congratulations, you've sabotaged the effectiveness of your team.

### Thoughts on People

Managers often create teams by looking for people with the right skills, but when they want to start a new project, they go out and try to find new people with the skills for that project. I don't think that this is the most effective way to put together teams. Once you have a really effective software development team that collaborates well, trusts each other, respects each other, and knows how to build on the strengths within the team, this team should never be broken up. Instead, those are the people you want to tackle the complex, high risk, uncertain problems. It's much easier for a developer to learn a new language or platform than it is to teach a new team how to work together at a similar performance level.

To me, this is why the Agile Manifesto says that we value "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". No matter how effective our teams become, the efficiency is a byproduct of how the team members collaborate with each other. It's simply not possible to replace a team member and hope that the processes and tools keep the team running at the same velocity. For this reason, I value good people above all else. If I were forced to make a decision between people and tools, I would rather have a great team and use index cards instead of having JIRA.

Agile teams don't appear overnight. Being agile means being adaptive. It means learning from mistakes and removing developer friction (in the form of bugs and technical debt). It also means learning how to collaborate better. It's a journey that the team takes together and that's something that takes time.
