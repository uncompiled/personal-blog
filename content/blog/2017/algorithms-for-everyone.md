I'm writing a series of articles about common computer science algorithms
on [Medium](https://medium.com/@uncompiled).

Algorithms are really nothing more than a process used to solve a problem,
but most textbooks on algorithms assume the reader has a background in
computer science or mathematics.  I've spent many hours studying
algorithms reading (and re-reading) proofs by induction and I don't think
that this is the best method for learning how algorithms work.

Other people have already proved the mathematical correctness of these
algorithms, so my goal is to explain *what* a specific algorithm does,
*how* it works, and *why* you should care about this algorithm using
approachable language and relatable examples.

If this content helps you, please let me know.  That would encourage me
to write more articles.
